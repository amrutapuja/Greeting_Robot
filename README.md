# Greeting_Robot
 AI-powered greeting robot developed for the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) department at KIT's College of Engineering. The robot acts as a smart assistant that interacts with visitors, provides navigation support, and answers common queries — all while being built using cost-effective hardware and open-source tools.
